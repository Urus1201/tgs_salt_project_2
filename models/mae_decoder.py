    Masked Autoencoder Decoder for the TGS Salt Identification Challenge.
    
    This decoder takes encoded visible patches and reconstructs the full image
    including the masked patches. It uses a lightweight transformer architecture
    to predict the contents of masked regions.

        decoder_num_heads: Number of attention heads in each transformer layer
